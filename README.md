// Darcy Rose - Looks good! I enjoyed learning more about you. The layout is clean and visually appealing, and the text is legible for the most part. There is a small issue with legibility when it overlaps with the stock image tag on the main page. You could try sourcing the image from Unsplash to avoid that. Also, instead of doing a bunch of breaks you could maybe add your images at the bottom into a container and position using a class and flexbox css. Saves you a good amount of coding lines. Just some thoughts! Well done :)
